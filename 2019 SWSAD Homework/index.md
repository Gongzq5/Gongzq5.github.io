> **SWSAD** stand for **Software System Analysis and Design**

> The reason why there is such a page is that I don't like to establish all of my homework or assignments as part of my blog content since they are not good tutorials or QA things ... which means not so helpful for most of readers (of course, except the other students of the course). So a single page is used here as a special homework one ... But if there is any very useful text, I will think about put it in the home page !
